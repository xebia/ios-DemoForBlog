## iOS Demo code for blog posting

This project is a work in progress containing various pieces of code for demo purposes. The application consists of a tabbed view. Each tab contains a presentation of a general topic area of interest for an iOS developer.

* The XSDFirstViewController contains an example of a tableview being filled by a NSFetchedResultsController. The core data store undeneath all this is being modified on another thread and all changes will constantly be pushed into the table view by syncing the relevant core data contexts.

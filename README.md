## iOS Demo code for blog posting

This project is a work in progress containing various pieces of code for demo purposes. The application consists of a tabbed view. Each tab contains a presentation of a general topic area of interest for an iOS developer.

* The XSDFirstViewController contains an example of a tableview being filled by a NSFetchedResultsController. The presentation part is finished, the asynchrounous data generator and manipulation on core date store still needs to be added.
